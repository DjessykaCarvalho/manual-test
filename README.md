# Manual Test Project

This is a test project created as part of the Manual company's selection process. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use of modern technologies, such as Next.js, TypeScript, Styled Components, ESLint, and Prettier, for web application development.

## Technologies

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/): A React framework for server-side rendering and building modern web applications.

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): A typed programming language that adds static typing features to JavaScript.

- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/): A library for styling React components using CSS-in-JS.

- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/): A static code analysis tool that helps maintain clean and consistent JavaScript/TypeScript code.

- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/): A code formatter that ensures consistent code style throughout the project.
